Recall that we just calculated that the \"converted\" probability (or rate) for the old page is *slightly* higher than that of the new page.\n\nIf we want to assume that the old page is better unless the new page proves to be definitely better at a Type I error rate of 5% (Type I error means rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually true), what should be our null and alternative hypothesis (**$H_0$** and **$H_1$**)?  \n\nWe can state our hypothesis in terms of **$p_{old}$** and **$p_{new}$**, which are the \"converted\" probability (or rate) for the old and new pages respectively.","metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**We can define our null hypothesis H0 as pnew=pold, and our alternative H1 as pnew>pold.**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Null Hypothesis $H_0$ Testing\n\nUnder the null hypothesis $H_0$, assume that $p_{new}$ and $p_{old}$ are equal.

So, our assumption is:\n<center>\n$p_{new}$ = $p_{old}$ = $p_{population}$\n</center>\n\nIn this section, we will: \n\n- Simulate (bootstrap) sample data set for both groups, and compute the  \"converted\" probability $p$ for those samples. \n- Use a sample size for each group equal to the ones in the `df2` data.\n- Compute the difference in the \"converted\" probability for the two samples above. \n- Perform the sampling distribution for the \"difference in the converted probability\" between the two simulated-samples over 10,000 iterations and calculate an estimate.","metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**a.** What is the **conversion rate** for $p_{new}$ under the null hypothesis?

[Here](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.stats.proportion.proportions_ztest.html) is a helpful link on using the built in.\n\nThe syntax is: \n```bash\nsm.stats.proportions_ztest(count_array, nobs_array, alternative='larger')\n```\nwhere, \n- `count_array` = represents the number of \"converted\" for each group\n- `nobs_array` = represents the total number of observations (rows) in each group\n- `alternative` = choose one of the values from `[‘two-sided’, ‘smaller’, ‘larger’]` depending upon two-tailed, left-tailed, or right-tailed respectively. That is :\n\nIt's a two-tailed (two-sided) if you defined $H_1$ as $(p_{new} = p_{old})$. <br>\nIt's a left-tailed (smallar) if you defined $H_1$ as $(p_{new} < p_{old})$. <br>\nIt's a right-tailed (larger) if you defined $H_1$ as $(p_{new} > p_{old})$. In here our alternative (H1) is pnew>pold.\n\nThe built-in function above will return the z_score and p_value.\n\n---\n### About The Two-Sample Z-Test\nRecall that we have plotted a distribution `p_diffs` representing the\ndifference in the \"converted\" probability  $(p{'}_{new}-p{'}_{old})$  for our two simulated samples 10,000 times. \n\nAnother way for comparing the mean of two independent and normal distribution is a **two-sample z-test**. You can perform the Z-test to calculate the Z_score, as shown in the equation below:\n\n$$\nZ_{score} = \\frac{ (p{'}_{new}-p{'}_{old}) - (p_{new}  -  p_{old})}{ \\sqrt{ \\frac{\\sigma^{2}_{new} }{n_{new}} + \\frac{\\sigma^{2}_{old} }{n_{old}}  } }\n$$\n\nwhere,\n\n- $p{'}$ is the \"converted\" success rate in the sample\n- $p_{new}$ and $p_{old}$ are the \"converted\" success rate for the two groups in the population. \n- $\\sigma_{new}$ and $\\sigma_{old}$ are the standard deviation for the two groups in the population. \n- $n_{new}$ and $n_{old}$ represent the size of the two groups or samples (it's same in our case)\n\nZ-test is performed when the sample size is large, and the population variance is known. The z-score represents the distance between the two \"converted\" success rates in terms of the standard error.\n\nNext step is to make a decision to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis based on comparing these two values: \n- $Z_{score}$\n- $Z_{\\alpha}$ or $Z_{0.05}$, also known as critical value at 95% confidence interval.  $Z_{0.05}$ is 1.645 for one-tailed tests,  and 1.960 for two-tailed test. You can determine the $Z_{\\alpha}$ from the z-table manually. \n\nDecide if your hypothesis is either a two-tailed, left-tailed, or right-tailed test. Accordingly, reject OR fail to reject the  null based on the comparison between $Z_{score}$ and $Z_{\\alpha}$. We determine whether or not the $Z_{score}$ lies in the \"rejection region\" in the distribution. In other words, a \"rejection region\" is an interval where the null hypothesis is rejected if the $Z_{score}$ lies in that region.\n\nFor a right-tailed test, reject null if $Z_{score}$ > $Z_{\\alpha}$.\n\nFor a left-tailed test, reject null if $Z_{score}$ < $Z_{\\alpha}$.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import statsmodels.api as sm\n\n# Calculating the z_score and p_value with the sm.stats.proportions_ztest() method arguments\nz_score, p_value = sm.stats.proportions_ztest([convert_old, convert_new], [n_old, n_new])\n\nprint(z_score, p_value)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"1.3109241984234394 0.18988337448195103\n"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**n.** What do the z-score and p-value we computed in the previous question mean for the conversion rates of the old and new pages?

But our Z-score is 1.31 and is not bigger than Z-alpha.\n\nAnd this p-value (0.189) is similar to the p-value before (0.199) We can say that the z-test appears to agree with the previous observations.
