## General Information
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.10.5

## Setup
You need to download the "ab_data.csv" which is including some experiments about various customers based on e-commerce website affairs and "countries.csv" data which contains the same user_id from ab_data and additional countr column. 

## Usage
In this project our goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should:

*Implement the new webpage,
*Keep the old webpage,
*Or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

If you try to answer some same questions in your another webpage traffic based project, you can use this project as a template for yourself.
